A mixture of Jewish, Muslim  and Christian without going into depth about religion but tracing their ways of life between Syria and New York and all interacting at the beginning of the last century.

Maybe it's not a book for all, but I'm not easy to please and it's definitely left me thinking.  4 Stars as I wouldn't call it a masterpiece although well written..and the ending leaves plenty of room for the sequel, The HiddenPalace.

Lord, I must have been desperately  escaping from work/life or something. I've attempted to read other James Patterson books without much success in the past,  but I just seem to remember the Alex Cross series as decent.  I have read that most of Patterson'… વધુs  books are based on his story idea with other writers actually doing the writing. Thus many books with two authors listed on the cover.  Anyway, back to Alex Cross. I like books about the same characters, so decided to read the series. They are truly atrocious. Poor grammar and poorly written.  Cliche comments. Ridiculous characters and story plot.   A lot of blonds with piecing blue eyes. Gratuitous violence.  The audibles also have some very white sounding guys trying to narrate for a black character. Uffda! Not good.  Sorry. Thanks for listening to my rant. I think I'm just surprised at the popularity of this drivel. I need a new series.

I was reading this out… વધુ loud to my son when I came across a meet and greet/book signing with Orson Scott Card and my husband's ears perked up. My husband is a huge enders game series fan as well as Orson Scott Card fan. We decided to attend and my husband bought Orson's new book A town divided by Christmas. What was really cool is the kid who Ender is based off of was there that night and we got to meet him too. My husband was fan girling soooo hard lol. We had just had a baby in July and she was quietly sleeping on my shoulder. After the QandA Orson says if you have tiny littles you get to go to the front of the line so the children don't get tired of being there and we had the smallest of the kids so we were first.

Flight was a very good family drama.  Locust Lane and The Last Party were both good and surprising domestic… વધુ suspense novels.  Guilty Admissions was a fascinating account of the college admissions scandal - it truly was amazing the lengths these parents would go to and the amount of mobey they would spend to get their kids into the “right” school.  Maureen was a short and sweet conclusion to the Harold Fry trilogy.  Just the Nicest Couple was a good thriller.  The Bullet That Missed is the third book in the Thursday Murder Club series - it was so entertaining and enjoyable.  Bookworm was the only book I really didn’t like - it was not a light and fun rom com like the cover implies.  It was much darker and the characters were all just so unlikable.

I am not compelled to keep up with all of the bestsellers. My usual approach  is to check out 10 or so books from the local library, based on the title and cover. Yes, there are times I go seeking a specific title or (more likely) author, but it is usually a free-spirited outing for… વધુ me. I.e. regardless of what I come out with, going to the library is a happy thing. My latest book was The Book of Longings. Before that, the Woman in Cabin 10.   I would like to join this group so I can latch on to other good reads and engage in stirring commentary.  Or not. I just enjoy my time spent reading  and wish to celebrate the individuals who create the stories for the rest of us to enjoy. It is also about affirming the feelings and values we all share.  If this is not the the proper venue to find what i seek, then I would greatly appreciate a recommended alternative.  Thanks.",55,0,84,2023-02-05 15:59:12

It also takes place in a… વધુ small town that’s main activity is the town’s High School Hockey Team. I was not sure I would enjoy this one. I really did though and got very wrapped up with the characters. I think Fredrik Backman is brilliant at this. Then the second book came out, Us Against You, which continues the story. I liked it, but enjoyed Beartown better. Now, I just got The Winners. I have been waiting for it to come out for a long time. Really looking forward to reading it. I have heard mostly Very Positive Reviews about this book. I am really active on Goodreads and had to try and not read any friends reviews since I didn’t want to have any spoilers.

Thanks to the person who recommended it. I rarely get… વધુ emotional with any books and I'm a more spiritual than religious person..but this book had me 'believing' in all the characters 'real' and fiction.  Accurate historically and flawless writing without excessive vocabulary.  From Agios(Saint in Greek)to today's Father... Christ...mas, so originally fusioned together with the birth and death of Jesus..then Christ, plus all the historical and fictionalized personalities. It got me so emotional that I had a few bad nights thinking about it.  So many books don't leave a mark...this book will stay with me forever.  Only a very humane and sensitive person could write something like this. Highly recommendable to all faiths...this is a book about faith, giving and real love, which I think we need a lot of in this world.  A Happy 'real' Xmas to all #Review#",3,0,3,2023-02-05 15:59:12

The 100 Year Old Man Who Climbed Out The Window and Disappeared was enjoyable and funny but a little long.  Allen’s adventures reminded me of Forrest Gump.

I envy the reader who will read all three books consecutively.  Mad Honey was another very good book from Jodi… વધુ Picoult.  The Man Who Died Twice is the second book in the Thursday Murder Club series and was just as entertaining as the first book.  Daisy Darker was a great thriller with some surprising twists.  Three Things About Elsie was okay but I wouldn’t go out of my way to read it.  I’m Glad My Mom Died was an excellent memoir about Jennette McCurdy’s life as a child actress and her relationship with her mother.  I also started but did not finish The Passenger by Cormac McCarthy - it was nothing like the description and I gave up after I read about a third of the book.

It's a prequel in the Royal Mates Series, and I think it's going to change your life.  It's a dark paranormal romance novella that takes place before the events of her first novel, Fated to the Triplet Kings, which was one of those books that just blew your mind. If you haven't read it yet, go do it now! Seriously—you won't regret it. Anyway, back to Mated to the Enemy: This story follows the rogue werewolf Alicia as she falls in love with her enemy. It's full of action and adventure and a lot of twists and turns along the way—so much so that the ending had me gasping for air when I read it (and it has been years since that happened).

Thrust into Rebecca's position at the Manderley estate, the otherwise nameless Mrs. de Winter moves through Rebecca's routines, inadequately filling her shoes.

He struggles to establish an honest and vulnerable relationship with his new wife, further driving her into the shadows of doubt and inadequacy. Ultimately, Du Maurier successfully explores how people become lost in despair--despair over loss, despair over guilt, despair over failure.",33,1,72,2023-02-05 15:59:12

I loved Britt-Marie Was Here and can’t believe I hadn’t read it sooner.  The Family Game was twisty and fun… વધુ thriller.  The Thursday Murder Club was such a fun read - I can’t wait to read the rest of the series.  The House Party was an okay domestic suspense - I wouldn’t go out of my way to read.  All the Lies They Did Not Tell was interesting account the Satanic Panic in Italy in the 90s. I didn’t love Our Wives Under the Sea even though it was very well written - I don’t know who the target audience is and it left me with way too many questions.  I didn’t really care for All That’s Left Unsaid - it was slow and depressing.

I felt as if she was a kindred spirit, who evoked character traits of both Jo March of Little Women and Elizabeth Bennet of Pride and Prejudice.

I loved the plot twist at the end of the story that I didn’t see coming. “The Good Sister” is the story of fraternal twin sisters Fern and Rose. The story is told with an alternating narrative with Fern as… વધુ the main character, who is on the spectrum, taking place in the present.

Think flappers, bootleggers, prohibition, speakeasies like the Christopher Club in 1920’s New York City, and you’ll catch a glimpse of what this novel is all about. Interspersed with the romp through the ‘20’s though is the present day life of Ella… વધુ Gilbert, who lives in an apartment building adjacent to the former notorious Christopher Club, due to her separation from her wayward husband. It is said that strains of jazz clarinets can be heard through the walls of the laundry room in Ella’s building. There is romance, a cruel stepfather, mad chases through the countryside, and much more activity to compel the reader to keep on truckin’ through this novel.

She has a cochlear implant and has been in mainstream public school for most of her life.

So basically you buy things, and Amazon uses a portion of what you spend… વધુ (0.5%), and donates to the charity of your choice—and there are SO MANY to choose from including LIBRARIES. And it's no cost to you. It's really easy to set up, in the Amazon app, you go to Settings (on the main menu, by the cusomer service button.) Click Amazon Smile, and pick the charity you want Amazon to donate to. It costs us nothing. And we get to help people when getting things we are gonna get anyway.❤",58,2,105,2023-02-05 15:59:12

Both women are guarding dark secrets and have spent many years building up protective armor against the outside world. As their tentative friendship evolves, the armor begins to fall away and Margaret opens her house to the younger woman. This launches a series of unanticipated events, leading Margaret to discover a way to redeem her cursed past, and Wanda to learn the true purpose of her cross-country journey.

If you enjoyed “The Thursday Murder Club” then you will LOVE “Signs of Life”. Brilliant. Funny. Clever.  If you are a Cozy Mystery fan I think… વધુ you are going to LOVE this!  I don’t know how to do this wonderful book justice.   In this fresh new series Holt introduces Bentley as a retired detective who is having a hard time adjusting to life without a badge.   He has a heart of gold and just can’t say “no” when help is needed, even when it puts himself in harms way and causes a riff in his family.   A real page-turner from the start, Holt touches on struggles facing young and old.  I found myself rooting for Bentley and friends that resulted in few late nights since I just couldn’t put it down.   Can’t wait for the next book to find out what happens to Bentley and friends.

The story… વધુ unfolds about Geli Strub is the wife of a German officer, her circumstances, her control, her rations have been cut off and she faced a difficult situation, because her choice was starving versus reviving. She’s a spy for a German Officer, Kurt, in Berlin. She finds herself falling in love with a man who believes she is someone else.

Even though I haven’t quite finished it yet, I highly recommend it as there are many varied aspects, not just political, presented in her family’s story. One point that stands out as I was reading last night: the acceptance, albeit reluctant and resigned, by so many married women (and society in general) of their husband’s philandering ways and having concubines/2nd wives. It may be hard for us Vietnamese growing up in America to understand this, and it’s unbelievable that it still occurs today, yes, even in America. But sadly, it’s also the story that runs in many of our families. I could never accept this as a cultural “norm” and would not EVER let a man hurt me this way. Why do women have to continue to accept the subjugation to men’s needs and wants?? We have to be stronger than that and stop allowing it to happen.

The prominent writers of the 1920’s and 1930’s frequented Shakespeare and Company, and it became a gathering place for people like Ernest Hemingway, Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein and, of course, James Joyce, whose novel ""Ulysses"" Ms. Beach published in segments.  This is an interesting glimpse into a time when prohibition was on in the USA, and many artists and writers escaped to Europe to enjoy the lifestyle, and the discussion of banned books and pirating manuscripts was enlightening.

His son Fong See later built a mercantile empire and married a Caucasian woman, in spite of laws prohibiting interracial marriage. Lisa herself grew up playing in her family's antiques store in Los Angeles's Chinatown, listening to stories of missionaries and prostitutes, movie stars and Chinese baseball teams.With these stories and her own years of research, Lisa See chronicles the one-hundred-year-odyssey of her Chinese-American family, a history that encompasses racism, romance, secret marriages, entrepreneurial genius, and much more, as two distinctly different cultures meet in a new world.Lisa See has written several books in a variety of genres.

It is an amazing story of how one woman did not… વધુ give up on exposing the abuses of the mental health system, such as it was, during the mid 1800’s.

I found Kate Moore’s writing style highly readable and it made me want to keep going to find out how it would all turn out. Moore not only brought to life Elizabeth Packard but she also delved into how the insane asylums were used to put away women who did not conform to the society of that time.

Anderson and his co-writer managed to cover the Vanderbilt's lives over decades in such an interesting way. Their wealth was incredible… વધુ at one time. So many worked hard for the money and others only knew how to spend.  Even Anderson's Mother spent money like it was water when she married his Father who was very wealthy. When Anderson's Father was dying-he was worried she'd end up broke. We all know though that she surprised everyone w/her Gloria Vanderbilt jeans and made her own fortune. Unfortunately Gloria went through most of her money. She really didn't know what it was like not to have it. You'll be surprised at just what Anderson Cooper inherited and how he handled his own earned money. Gloria was wild and free and totally eccentric. This book is not all about Anderson and his Mother.

So for those of you who aren't Christian maybe you're stepping away from this story but maybe you should dive in and be open to the fact that there's many who grapple with the idea of God and others who fully embrace but stories about faith in all forms exist aplenty.

The time period is one not usually used as the background for a historical novel. You will learn a lot about the English… વધુ Civil Wars in the 1600s, led by Oliver Cromwell, that resulted in the beheading of King Charles I. The cast of characters are the kind we love. Or love to hate. From the determined Emma Hardcastle, daughter of a viscount; to her true love, the disinherited Scottish laird Colin Blackburne; to Emma’s friend, the hapless Alston Egerton, regularly abused by his pious and hypocritical father; and finally to the nefarious Captain Kitts, whose misdeeds are too numerous to mention.

I love the way that she wrote the book it was really like you were living it not just reading it I absolutely loved how even at the end of the book you still were left guessing wondering which was true what really happened definitely an amazing author and I look forward to reading more of her work since this was the first book I ever read of hers. Also this book can be a little gritty a lot of different explicit sexual scenes that are written so if this isn't something that you can push through I highly stay strongly suggest not to read it.,28,1,46,2023-02-05 15:59:12

Frank Drum, the narrator, is an adult telling the story from his life as a 13-year-old boy living in New Bremen, Minnesota, in 1961.  Frank’s father was the town minister, who served three different protestant congregations in the area.  Unexpected, unsolved deaths… વધુ have occurred in New Bremen, beginning with the death of a young boy, Bobby Cole, who was killed by a train while he was on the tracks of a railway trestle over the river – an event that caused Frank in his quest to understand Bobby’s death to call it “the “awful grace of God.”  Four more deaths occur that summer, and Frank, a perceptive boy with a gift for listening in on adult conversations, is instrumental in solving most of them.  To quote Simon & Schuster, the publisher:  “It is an unforgettable novel about discovering the terrible price of wisdom and the enduring grace of God.”  This is a book I personally savored.  Mr. Krueger has a wonderful ability to draw the reader in and never let you go till the story is finished.",59,0,110,2023-02-05 15:59:12

I must confess that I spent the first half of this book trying to convince myself that I liked it enough to finish it.  But now that I’ve read this story of racial identity, I’m glad I stuck with it and didn’t give up.   This story takes place… વધુ during the period from the 1940’s to the 1990’s.  Desiree and Stella Vignes are identical twins raised in Mallard, Louisiana, a town exclusively populated by light-skinned blacks. When the twins decide to escape the stultifying atmosphere of their small town, one of them disappears and reinvents herself as a white person.

The small portions of the story told from the child’s point of view were poignant, but the conduct of the adults, from the mother, the father, the mother’s long-time male friend, even the judge who tried the murder case against the mother – all were at times over-the-top unbelievable for me.  Having said that, I am not sorry I read the book.  As it happens, it was the July pick for my book club, and we had a very interesting discussion about it this morning.",17,0,14,2023-02-05 15:59:12

Some of the stories are just strange and made no sense to me.  ‘Where the Wild Ladies Are’ by Aoko Matsuda is a collection of ghost stories that's spooky, original and definitely feminist as all of the men are immensely frowned upon for their behavior in real life. It seems that the women in this novel who are now ghosts all have had some bad experiences and those are shared throughout the novel.  There are some really great (and spooky) stories and some that are just odd and I myself did not get the meaning. Perhaps, being a man, that is to be expected? I don’t know, but I will say that this is an original novel and a pretty fast and easy read.

Totally recommend this book to everyone.  I would just like to say I imagine this would be a very emotional read for someone who struggles with mental illness as despite not suffering from any mental disorder this book hit me hard.  This book has so many beautiful quotes, sharing a few:  ""Your now is not your forever"" ""True terror isn't being scared, its not having a choice in the matter"" ""Who… વધુ",13,3,27,2023-02-05 15:59:12

It definitely makes you wonder what you would do if given the chance to go back in time or to the future.

It's just not a genre I would have thought I'd enjoy. Pleasantly surprised is an understatement. When I first started reading it I was… વધુ picturing in my head The Invincibles. Literally. And I was wondering if maybe I was just too old for some of the humour but it was a fun and lively story pace with snappy dialogue and I wanted to know what happens next. As the story progressed I was completely picturing this as a movie and I wanted to call Ryan Reynolds but he doesn't know me so it's unlikely we'd get to chat about it ;-) I totally enjoyed this story. Lots of action and great characters. Could there be a sequel coming? I'm totally down for that! And although I can't act I'd love a role if this does become a movie (in case anyone is listening).  This isn't just an anti-superhero story. It's about women in the workplace, office politics today and rage/revenge all handled with wit and a very observant eye.

This FMS seems to be becoming of a plague and the number of suicides is rapidly rising. The novel explodes forward from there. The other principle, Helena Smith, is a neuroscientist who recreates technology that has the power to change time and reality, giving people the ability to go back and re-do parts of their lives. Time travel and memory are the major themes; but one of the core aspects of the book is Barry and Helena’s love story. Falling in love makes the stakes of them saving the world even greater. This book is the inspiration for Shondaland’s upcoming Netflix film.",10,1,18,2023-02-05 15:59:12

Raymond is a teenage boy who is falling through the cracks.  His parents divorced so now he lives with his mother and his stepfather and three younger half-sisters, and spends every other weekend with his father whose wife leaves when Raymond… વધુ arrives.  At school he has no friends.  He feeds a stray cat and feels like a loser.  One day a blind woman who lives in his building cautiously asks him “Have you see Luis Velez?”  I really found this to be a profound story in that Raymond, who is shy but an excellent student and a very smart young man, takes on the responsibility of walking Millie, his blind elderly neighbor, to the bank and the store, and attempts to find out what happened to her friend, Luis Velez, who kindly took Millie under his wing in the same manner until he suddenly stopped coming around.

Ellen feels compelled to look into the situation and the story takes off from there.  You’ll be rooting for Ellen and Will throughout the book.

Maybe they assume they don't have to since I've finished the book?
